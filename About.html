    <h1> Smart. Savvy. Strong </h1> 
    <h2> Mission </h2> 
      <p> We are women of innovation who remain devoted to excellence in all aspects of our lives and strive to be outstanding role models for future generations by demonstrating a passion for the empowerment of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math.</p> 
    <h2> Why We Reign  </h2> 
      <p> There are many parts of our team that differentiate us from other FIRST robotics teams though the most prominent is the diversity of our all-girl team. Reign Robotics 5588 is the only all-girls FIRST robotics team in Washington State. This unique aspect gives us both the opportunity and the obligation to provide more female representation in a typically male-dominated field.  Our hope is to inspire, empower and encourage other women to join the STEAM movement.  We have seen the impact of this empowerment firsthand from our own team that has exponentially grown over the years.  Our girls create a unique community with a wide variety of student backgrounds and passions. Although every girl may love robotics, each of us brings other insights from our lives. The different perspectives brought from each team member allows us to be both idiosyncratic and cohesive.  As a result, we are a group made up of people dedicated to hard work, innovation, and collaboration. We currently have over 30 members serving as a community dedicated to improving opportunities for women in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) fields working with FIRST® Robotics. FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an organization that seeks to further education in STEAM and their vision is to “To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders.”

    <h2> Past Seasons and Awards  </h2> 
      <p>
        <em> 2018 </em>>

        In 2018, Zelda – our robot, was able to consistently climb and place cubes on both the high and low scales. We started off our season with a double parking space ramp but replaced this feature with a grappling hook climber that allowed us to hook first and climb second. Although we were a first round pick in our second competition, we were unable to advance to PNW District Championships for the first time in our team history. Reign has high hopes to defend our Girl’s Generation champion title this off season and can’t wait for the 2019 competition.
      
      
      </p> 

      <p>
        <em> 2017 </em>>

        In 2017, our robot, Victoria, was able to consistently climb and place many gears on the airship. Our season began with a strong placement in our first competition, finishing as the second place alliance. Advancing to PNW District Championships, the team had high hopes to make a debut at World Championships. Although we were not selected for alliances, the team received the Team Spirit Award which sent us to Worlds for the first time. In the Hopper division, Reign advanced to quarterfinals and won an award. With high energy, Reign became Girl’s Generation 2017 champions which set them up for the upcoming 2018 season.
      
      
      </p> 


      <p>
        <em> 2016 </em>>

        In its second year, 5588 Reign continued its upward momentum as we prepared for an attempt at returning to FRC District Championships in the 2016 Stronghold season. Although we faced with troubles receiving sponsorship, comparatively limited membership, and a general lack of knowledge on the construction and strategy of building a robot, Reign was able to once again advance to Districts, and made an even stronger impact in the 2016 season. Our business team was particularly strong, winning Reign several awards.
      
      
      </p> 


      <p>
        <em> 2015 </em>>

        Our rookie year, competing in FRC’s 2015 Recycle Rush, was fraught with both challenges to overcome and triumphs to inspire hope and build upon. Any new comer to a FIRST Robotics Competition knows that the process and atmosphere can be daunting, but with the help of our lead mentors Eric Van Buren, Chelsea Olson, and Alida Mendes, and the contributions of our amazing donors, we were able to establish a very successful first year that prompted continuous growth.
